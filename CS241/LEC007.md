# CS241 - LEC007: Regular Languages
Built using finite languages
- allow union
  - L1 U L2 = { x | x belongs L1, x belongs L2 }
- allow concatenation
  - L1 . L2 = { xy | x belongs L1, y belongs L2 }
- Repitition
  - L* = { epsilon } U { xy | x belongs L*, y belongs L }
- **Regular Expressions:** One way of specifying a regular language.
- RE are a convenient shrothand for specifying Reg. Lang. bit not very convenient for recognition.
- Another way to specify/recognize Regular Languages is to use a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata)

### DFA Recognition Algorithm
```
input DFA(Σ, Q, q0, A, δ)
input word w = a1a2.....an (ai ∈ Σ)
output is ω ∈ L(DFA)?
  state <--- q0
  for i in 1 to n
      state <--- δ(state, ai)
  end for
  if state ∈ A
      return true
  else
      return false
```
We assume the presence of a hidden / implicit error state.
- If a transition is not defined on a given symbol, you transition to the error state.
- Once in the error state, always stay there.

A language is regular if there exists a DFA specifying it. (Kleene Theorem)
We can associate actions/code to a transition in a DFA.

## NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automata)
- We are going to look for any path to an accept state
- Keep following all paths until the end of input.

### Formally defining an NFA
NFA has 5 components - Σ, Q, A, q0, δ
δ is the only component that is different
```
δ : Q x Σ ---> P(Q)
```
