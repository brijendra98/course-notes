# CS241 - LEC004: More MIPS Assembly, Procedures

mult $s, $t
- Where does the result go?
- The result could be larger than 32 bits
- Result is stored in  hi(higher 32 bits) : lo(lower 32 bits)
- multu - unsigned multiplication

mfhi $d
mflo $d
 = = = = =
 div/divu
div $s, $t
lo <--- $s/ $t (quotient)
hi <--- $s% $t (remainder)

Example:
$1 contains the address of a 32 bit array of ints.
$2 contains the number of elements in the array.
Read array[3] into $3
$1 + (3 * 4)
