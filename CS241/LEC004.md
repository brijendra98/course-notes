# CS241 - LEC004: More MIPS Assembly, Procedures

mult $s, $t
- Where does the result go?
- The result could be larger than 32 bits
- Result is stored in  hi(higher 32 bits) : lo(lower 32 bits)
- multu - unsigned multiplication

mfhi $d
mflo $d
 = = = = =
 div/divu
div $s, $t
lo <--- $s/ $t (quotient)
hi <--- $s% $t (remainder)

Example:
$1 contains the address of a 32 bit array of ints.
$2 contains the number of elements in the array.
Read array[3] into $3
$1 + (3 * 4)

MIPS Program to do this:
lis $5
.word 3
lis $4
.word 4
mult $4, $5
mflo $5
add $5, $1, $5
lw $3, 0($5)
jr $31

## Procedures in Assembly
- The same registers are accessible to all code. Might need a way to preserve/protect register values.
- How to call then return from a procedure?

### Option 1
Divide registers between procedures
- might run out of registers
- won't work for recursive calls
### Option 2
Each calee (called procedures) should guarantee it leaves register values unchanged.
- Backup original values of registers. Where? -- RAM

Reserve and use a chunk of RAM memory in a  systematic way.
MIPS Loader helps
Sets up $30 to just past the last available spot

### Procedure
Procedures are created by using a label and then writing the procedure body.

Failed attempts to call the procedure:
- Problem: Need to remember what the return address of a procedure call. Where to resume once procedure call returns
  - jalr - jump of link register
    - jalr $s
    - $31 <--- PC, PC <---
