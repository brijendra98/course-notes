### Basics of Digital Logic Design
- Truth Table
- Sum of Products (Minimal Terms)
- Composed Truth table using "Don't cares"
  - Example:

|X  |Y  |Z  |F  |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|0  |0  |0  |0  |
|0  |0  |1  |0  |
|0  |1  |0  |0  |
|0  |1  |1  |0  |
|1  |0  |0  |0  |
|1  |0  |1  |0  |
|1  |1  |0  |0  |
|1  |1  |1  |0  |

- Simplification Laws and simplifying formulae using them
- Gates in Logic Design - AND, OR, NOT

### Transistors

#### NMOS Transistor

```
       |
       |
     _____
   ---------
  |         |   
  |         |
<--         ---
    
```
- If A = 1, then low resistance between drain and source (F = 0)
- If A = 0, then very high resistance between drain and source (F = 1)
- Problem: in A = 1 case, lots of current flow

#### PMOS Transistor

```
- Opposite behaviour to NMOS: – If A = 1, high resistance between drain and source – If A = 0, low resistance between drain and source – Transmits strong 1 but weak 0 • Denote inversion with “bubble”
