# CS 251 - LEC 003
### Basics of Digital Logic Design
- Truth Table
- Sum of Products (Minimal Terms)
- Composed Truth table using "Don't cares"
  - Example:

|X  |Y  |Z  |F  |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|0  |0  |0  |0  |
|0  |0  |1  |0  |
|0  |1  |0  |0  |
|0  |1  |1  |0  |
|1  |0  |0  |0  |
|1  |0  |1  |0  |
|1  |1  |0  |0  |
|1  |1  |1  |0  |

- Simplification Laws and simplifying formulae using them
- Gates in Logic Design - AND, OR, NOT

### Transistors

#### NMOS Transistor

```
       |
       |
     _____
   ---------
  |         |   
  |         |
<--         ---
    
```
- If A = 1, then low resistance between drain and source (F = 0)
- If A = 0, then very high resistance between drain and source (F = 1)
- Problem: in A = 1 case, lots of current flow

#### PMOS Transistor

```
- Opposite behaviour to NMOS:
  - If A = 1, high resistance between drain and source
  - If A = 0, low resistance between drain and source
  - Transmits strong 1 but weak 0
- Denote inversion with “bubble”

### CMOS Circuits
- CMOS circuits use both n-transistors and p-transistors
- Will build circuits with “clean” paths to exactly one of power and ground.
- No bad flow of current from power to ground
- No weak transmissions
