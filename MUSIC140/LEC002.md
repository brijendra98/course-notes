# MUSIC 140 - LEC 002

## Tin Pan Alley (Cont.)
- Style: Lyrics
  - idealized romance - beginning and ending
- Style: Music
  - easy to play
  - easy to sing - phrasing and range
  - AABA musical form (Upper case letters signify melody)
- Example: "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" (Arlen/Harburg, 1939)
- There was no 'youth music' or any age demographics. There was just popular music that everyone liked.

## Work Song
- Pass time / set pace, coordinate work.
- Song Leader
- "Floating pool of verse"

### Example: "Old Alabama" 1947
- Is being sung by prisoners
- Recording technology did not exist when slaves did
- Other people join in the leader in between when they recognize it. Song but also a game.

### Folk Music:
- performed by amateurs
- for self or community entertainment
- oral tradation
- more concern with tradition than innovation (lacking "self-consciousness")
