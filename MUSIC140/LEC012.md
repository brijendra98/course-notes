### Led Zeppelin (Continued)

**"Whole Lotta Love"** by Led Zeppelin

Center of experience is the Stadium concert. Why?
- No radio air play
- No video/music television
- Critical rejection in music press

Concert is the only place to "connect" with the band

Becomes focal point:
- Form of worship
- Rejection of the collective
- Adulation of technical mastery of an individual
- Presentation is similar to that of a corporation
- All bands have a definitive logo that is heavily projected
- Its not about the collective, it is about the individual

There are some topics left out and we would need to do reading about it. There will be definitively 1-2 questions from here on the final exam:
- Origin and development of Punk music which was rejecting the idea of stardom and greatness.

## Disco
Also a response to the above kind of music but it embraces the idea of stardom and says that everyone is a star.
- Elaborate clothing, lots of mirrors so that you could see yourself being a star.
- People involved in it were initially minorities who felt rejected by middle class white artists.
- It later transformed into Electronic Dance Music

## Hip Hop
- Folk Culture
- South Bronx, New York City - 1970s
- Rap / Break Dancing / Graffiti Art

After Bronx was abandoned by people and became sort-of like a wasteland, similar to England young people there were trying to figure out ways to express themselves but didn't have enough ways to do so. They started making graffiti art on subway trains and making music. All of this was an organic process and wasn't done in any systematised way.
