### Led Zeppelin (Continued)

**"Whole Lotta Love"** by Led Zeppelin

Center of experience is the Stadium concert. Why?
- No radio air play
- No video/music television
- Critical rejection in music press

Concert is the only place to "connect" with the band

Becomes focal point:
- Form of worship
- Rejection of the collective
- Adulation of technical mastery of an individual
- Presentation is similar to that of a corporation
- All bands have a definitive logo that is heavily projected
- Its not about the collective, it is about the individual

There are some topics left out and we would need to do reading about it. There will be definitively 1-2 questions from here on the final exam:
- Origin and development of Punk music which was rejecting the idea of stardom and greatness.

## Disco
Also a response to the above kind of music but it embraces the idea of stardom and says that everyone is a star.
- Elaborate clothing, lots of mirrors so that you could see yourself being a star.
- People involved in it were initially minorities who felt rejected by middle class white artists.
- It later transformed into Electronic Dance Music

## Hip Hop
