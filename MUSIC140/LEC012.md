### Led Zeppelin (Continued)

**"Whole Lotta Love"** by Led Zeppelin

Center of experience is the Stadium concert. Why?
- No radio air play
- No video/music television
- Critical rejection in music press

Concert is the only place to "connect" with the band

Becomes focal point:
- Form of worship
- Rejection of the collective
- Adulation of technical mastery of an individual
- Presentation is similar to that of a corporation
- All bands have a definitive logo that is heavily projected
