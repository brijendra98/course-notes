- 

One of the most famous of the "Cover Versions" was:

### Cover Version: "Tutti Frutti"
#### Original Song
**Little Richard (Richard Wayne Penniman)**
- Born 1932, Macon Georgia
- First big hit was **"Tutti Frutti"**
  - The song's original lyrics were modified to be less explicit so that it can be released on radio
  - Structure: 12 bar blues
  - Lots of energy, distortion, very present etc.
- Released late 1955 on Speciality Records (lyrics revised by Dorothy LaBostrie)
- "Crossover" hit #2 R&B, #17 Pop

#### Cover Version for "Tutti Frutti"
By **Pat Boone**
- Born 1934
- Was just breaking as a pop star in 1955
- Early 1956, releases a cover of **"Tutti Frutti"**

**About the Cover**
- Less distortion, more round voice
- All changes were deliberately made to make the song more appealing to white audiences
- No R&B, #10 Pop chart

### Cover Version: "Sh-Boom"
**Original:**
- Recorded originally in June 1954 by "The Chords" / Cat Records
- Became a hit on R&B's chart and then crossed over to Pop chart.

**Cover Version:**
- A couple weeks later, a cover version was released by "The Crew Cuts" in July 1954 / Mercury Records (A major label)
- "The Crew Cuts" were Canadian - from Toronto

**Comparison**
- In the cover version, voice feels more distant than original. More echo.
- We can hear the lead singer breathing in the original song.
- No distortion in cover song's voice and less proximity.
- All these changes were very deliberate to make it more appealing to white audience
- The idea of more distance comes from giving the listener more space as opposed to the original song where singers are right in the face.
- **Form**:
Original: 1x through AABA, with interludes.
Cover: 2xs through AABA - clearly stated
- **Voice**:
Original: Distorted - use of lower octave in B.
Cover: Clean, no use of lower octave.
- **Solo**:
Original: Sax - distorted timbre, sexual metaphor.
Cover: No solo - repeats of "Sh-Boom" group vocal - timpani joke.
- **The Chords**: #3 R&B / #5 Pop
**The Crew Cuts**: no R&B / #1 Pop, #1 for 9 weeks and #1 song of the year.
- Racist? Or a continuation of TPA traditions?
  - Yes, it was racist but the record companies were just trying to make money and market the song in the best way.
  - In this process they were playing to racist sentiments of the audience. They even made covers for Country songs by making them more pop-like and reducing country-elements.
  - These Race-based cover versions largely stopped by 1976
