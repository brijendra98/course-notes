1895-1912 - transition from cylinder to disks

1925 - industry standard speed set to 78 r.p.m.
- Why 1925? Record industry beginning rise to prominence during the 1920s
- Why 78 r.p.m.? A number picked as a balance between quality and how long a record would be. For standardization purposes

#### What was recorded?
