## Changes in Technology:
### "Mechanical Reproduction"
1877 - Edison invents the phonograph (gramophone)

1895-1912 - transition from cylinder to disks

1925 - industry standard speed set to 78 r.p.m.
- Why 1925? Record industry beginning rise to prominence during the 1920s
- Why 78 r.p.m.? A number picked as a balance between quality and how long a record would be. For standardization purposes

#### What was recorded?
- sheet music / TPA. Early record industry controlled by the same people who controlled TPA.
- black music / rural southern white music not recorded because:
  - generally not part of the TPA / sheet music industry
  - cultural chauvinism
  - rural areas - sales?

#### Commercial Radio: 1920
- Jan. 1922 - 28 stations / December 1922 - 570 Stations
- Controlled by only a few "Networks" (CBS, NBC, Mutual)
- First radio network; NBC in 1928
- Very few independent radio stations exist
- Network radio begins to changes patterns of consumption from regional to national

Success of Radio:
- expensive one-time purchase, unlimited content
- why buy records?

#### The Rise of the Record Industry:
Record industry concerned - needs to find new markets
- Ralph Peer - Okeh Records

- Mamie Smith: "Crazy Blues" (1920)
  - Ralph Peer's singer backed out at last moment but since he had to pay for stuff, Mamie Smith, an african-american (which was unusual for people recording records) was brought in.
  - This record sold well in middle-class white audience. Was the first popular recording by african-american artist.
