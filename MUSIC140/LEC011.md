### Altamont, California: (December, 1969)
- Rolling Stones tried to have their own version of Woodstock.
- They hired the Hells Angels motorcycle gang for security and paid them $500 with beer.
  - This was a bad decision as they beat up people, and made the event a disaster.
- Decision to have the concert in Altamont race track wasn't a good one due to the shortage of space.
